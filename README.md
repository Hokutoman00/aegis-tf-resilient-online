> **Hedge first, fallback second, continuously chaos-verified.**

On **April 20, 2026**, OpenAI went dark — ChatGPT, Codex, and the API platform, all of them, for hours. On **March 2-3, 2026**, Anthropic's Claude went down twice in 24 hours. On **November 18, 2025**, a Cloudflare incident took ChatGPT and Sora with it. Every major LLM provider has had at least one significant outage in the past 12 months.

Most "resilient" AI gateways — LiteLLM, OpenRouter, Portkey, even TrueFoundry's default Virtual Model fallback — **silently fail** on one of the most common production errors: Anthropic returning `400 credit_balance_too_low`. The HTTP code is in the 4xx range, so the gateway's fallback list (typically `[401, 403, 408, 429, 500, 502, 503]`) doesn't trigger. ([LiteLLM issue #24320](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/issues/24320) documents this gap across the industry.)

**Aegis is built on TrueFoundry's AI Gateway**, but doesn't trust it alone. Aegis adds seven layers of behavioral resilience and a verifiable runtime receipt, so an agent stays useful even when its dependencies — including its own gateway — break.

---

## The 7 layers

| Layer | Job | Owner | Invariant monitored |
|------:|---|---|---|
| **L0** | **Hedge** parallel requests on TTFT > p95 | Aegis | hedge cost < latency benefit (cost/latency receipt) |
| **L1** | **Retry** with exponential backoff + jitter | TF Gateway | retries are non-destructive (tool side-effect taxonomy) |
| **L2** | **Model fallback** within provider | TF Virtual Model | configured chain still has reachable models |
| **L3** | **Provider fallback** across providers | TF Virtual Model | TF Gateway itself is reachable (heartbeat) |
| **L4** | **Semantic error fallback** — error.type / .code | Aegis | error format stable (structured-first, regex fallback) |
| **L5** | **Graceful degradation contract** — budget / SLA / quality | Aegis | user contract is honored |
| **L6** | **Continuous self-chaos** in shadow | Aegis | chaos doesn't harm real users (output divergence monitored) |

Every response carries a signed **Aegis Receipt** — a JSON envelope showing which providers were tried, which layers fired, which contract budgets were spent, and how long ago Aegis last survived a chaos drill. See [docs/RECEIPT.md](./docs/RECEIPT.md).

## The differentiator: L4 catches what others miss

```
[2026-05-10 02:18:32]  user → Aegis → TF Virtual Model "claude-with-fallback"
[Aegis L0]             hedge fired (p95 = 1.5s exceeded)
[TF L1/L2]             anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 → 400 credit_balance_too_low
[TF L3]                fallback codes [401,403,...,503] don't include 400 → pass-through
[Aegis L4]             error.type=invalid_request_error + message="credit balance"
                       → reclassified as fallback-eligible
                       → routed to openai/gpt-4.1
[OpenAI]               200 OK, 320ms TTFT
[Aegis L0]             cancel hedge (cost saved: ~$0.0001)
[Aegis Receipt]        attached to response
```

This single error class (`credit_balance_too_low`) is what brings down most LLM apps the moment a credit card expires. Aegis is the first agent runtime to handle it.

## Demo scenarios (5/23-25 recording)

| # | Failure injected | Layers that fire | Visible UX |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | hedge race (p95 spike) | L0 only | "Hedge canceled in 80ms" annotation |
| B | Anthropic `credit_balance_too_low` 400 | L4 catches, routes to OpenAI | "Provider switched" + Receipt |
| C | MCP server (search) returns 30% errors | L0 MCP hedge (READ_HEDGE) wins | Slight latency, no error |
| D | TF Gateway itself returns 503 | TF SPOF bypass → direct provider | Receipt shows `tf_used: false` |
| E | All providers fail | L5 graceful contract + apologetic UX | Honest "I can't right now, but here's why" |
| F | Shadow chaos | L6 background drill | Receipt: `last_chaos_survival: 47s ago` |

All scenarios use [Toxiproxy](https://github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy) to inject *real* network failures, not mocked errors.

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in TRUEFOUNDRY_API_KEY from https://aegis-hackathon.truefoundry.cloud/

bun run dev
# server: http://localhost:3000

# exercise every layer in one shot
bash examples/demo.sh
```

`/v1/chat/completions` is OpenAI SDK-compatible (non-streaming and SSE
streaming both). Drop-in for any code already using the OpenAI SDK — just
point `base_url` at Aegis instead of `api.openai.com`.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | identity / motto / configured virtual model |
| `GET` | `/health` | uptime probe |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compat chat (stream + non-stream) |
| `POST` | `/v1/mcp/classify` | classify a tool name (READ_HEDGE / WRITE_TIED / UNKNOWN_TIED) |
| `POST` | `/v1/mcp/call` | execute a tool with classification-aware resilience |
| `GET` | `/v1/chaos/status` | latest L6 chaos drill outcome |

### Tests

```bash
bun test
# 50 tests, 0 fail, ~150 assertions, <1s
```

Lint / typecheck:

```bash
bun run lint && bun run typecheck
```
